MongoDB support for [Hangfire](http://hangfire.io/) library. By using this library you can store all jobs information in MongoDB.

# Installation

To install Hangfire MongoDB Storage, run the following command in the Nuget Package Manager Console:

```
PM> Install-Package Hangfire.Mongo
```

## Usage ASP.NET Core

```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    var mongoUrlBuilder = new MongoUrlBuilder("mongodb://localhost/jobs");
    var mongoClient = new MongoClient(mongoUrlBuilder.ToMongoUrl());

    // Add Hangfire services. Hangfire.AspNetCore nuget required
    services.AddHangfire(configuration => configuration
        .SetDataCompatibilityLevel(CompatibilityLevel.Version_180)
        .UseSimpleAssemblyNameTypeSerializer()
        .UseRecommendedSerializerSettings()
        .UseMongoStorage(mongoClient, mongoUrlBuilder.DatabaseName, new MongoStorageOptions
        {
            MigrationOptions = new MongoMigrationOptions
            {
                MigrationStrategy = new MigrateMongoMigrationStrategy(),
                BackupStrategy = new CollectionMongoBackupStrategy()
            },
            Prefix = "hangfire.mongo",
            CheckConnection = true
        })
    );
    // Add the processing server as IHostedService
    services.AddHangfireServer(serverOptions =>
    {
        serverOptions.ServerName = "Hangfire.Mongo server 1";
    });

    // Add framework services.
}
```

## Usage ASP.NET

```csharp
var options = new MongoStorageOptions
{
    MigrationOptions = new MongoMigrationOptions
    {
        MigrationStrategy = new DropMongoMigrationStrategy(),
        BackupStrategy = new NoneMongoBackupStrategy()
    }
};
GlobalConfiguration.Configuration.UseMongoStorage("mongodb://localhost/jobs", options);
app.UseHangfireServer();
app.UseHangfireDashboard();
```

## Usage Console

```csharp
var options = new MongoStorageOptions
{
    MigrationOptions = new MongoMigrationOptions
    {
        MigrationStrategy = new DropMongoMigrationStrategy(),
        BackupStrategy = new NoneMongoBackupStrategy()
    }
};
var mongoStorage = new MongoStorage(
                MongoClientSettings.FromConnectionString("mongodb://localhost"),
                "jobs", // database name
                options);
            
using(new BackgroundJobServer(mongoStorage))
{
  ...
}
```

## Custom collections prefix

To use custom prefix for collections names specify it on Hangfire setup:

```csharp
public void Configuration(IAppBuilder app)
{
    GlobalConfiguration.Configuration.UseMongoStorage("mongodb://localhost/ApplicationDatabase",
        new MongoStorageOptions { Prefix = "custom" } );

    app.UseHangfireServer();
    app.UseHangfireDashboard();
}
```

### Configuration Overrides

- `CheckQueuedJobsStrategy` (default: `Watch`)
  - `Watch` uses change streams to watch for enqueued jobs. Will still poll using 'QueuePollInterval'.
  - `Poll` will poll periodically using 'QueuePollInterval', recommended for large installments.
  - `TailNotificationsCollection` uses a capped, tailable collection to notify nodes of enqueued jobs. Will still poll using 'QueuePollInterval'. Works with single node MongoDB instances.

## Naming Convention
Hangfire.Mongo will ignore any naming conventions configured by your application.
E.g. if your application use camel casing like this:
```csharp
  var camelCaseConventionPack = new ConventionPack { new CamelCaseElementNameConvention() };
  ConventionRegistry.Register("CamelCase", camelCaseConventionPack, type => true);
```
it will be ignored by Hangfire.Mongo and Pascal Case will be used instead. Of cause only for Hangfire specific collections.

## Migration

We sometimes introduce breaking changes in the schema. For this reason we have introduced migration.
Three migration strategies exists.
- Throw

  This is the default migration strategy. It will throw an InvalidOperationException never letting you get up and running if there is a schema version mismatch. So it forces you to decide what migration strategy is best for you and at the same time keeps your data safe.
- Drop

  This will simply just drop your existing Hangfire.Mongo database and update the schema version. No fuzz and ready to start from scratch.
  It is the perfect strategy if you e.g. enque all your jobs at startup.
- Migrate

  This will migrate your database from one schema version to the next until the required schema version is reached. Chances are that not all data can be migrated, why some loss of data might occur. Please use with caution and thougoughly test before deploying to production. We are not responsible for data loss.

  NOTE: Only forward migration is supported. If you need to revert to a previous schema version, you need to **manually** drop or restore the previous database.

```csharp
public void Configuration(IAppBuilder app)
{
    var migrationOptions = new MongoMigrationOptions
    {
        MigrationStrategy = new MigrateMongoMigrationStrategy(),
        BackupStrategy = new CollectionMongoBackupStrategy()
    };
    var storageOptions = new MongoStorageOptions
    {
        // ...
        MigrationOptions = migrationOptions
    };
    GlobalConfiguration.Configuration.UseMongoStorage("<connection string with database name>", storageOptions);

    app.UseHangfireServer();
    app.UseHangfireDashboard();
}
```

NOTE: By default the parameter `InvisibilityTimeout` of the `MongoStorageOptions` is configured with the value `null`, making the job to stay in status 'processing' in case of an error in the application. To solve this issue, set the value to 30 minutes like in the [SqlServerStorageOptions](https://docs.hangfire.io/en/latest/configuration/using-sql-server.html).

```csharp
public void Configuration(IAppBuilder app)
{
    var migrationOptions = new MongoMigrationOptions
    {
        MigrationStrategy = new MigrateMongoMigrationStrategy(),
        BackupStrategy = new CollectionMongoBackupStrategy()
    };
    var storageOptions = new MongoStorageOptions
    {
        // ...
        MigrationOptions = migrationOptions,
        InvisibilityTimeout = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(30)
    };
    GlobalConfiguration.Configuration.UseMongoStorage("<connection string with database name>", storageOptions);

    app.UseHangfireServer();
    app.UseHangfireDashboard();
}
```

### Migration Backup
By default no backup is made before attempting to migrate.
You can backup Hangfire collections by "cloning" each collection to the same database.
Alternatively you can just write your own, by inheriting MongoBackupStrategy and use that implementation.

NOTE: This software is made by humans in our sparetime - we do our best but will not be held responsible for any data loss.
